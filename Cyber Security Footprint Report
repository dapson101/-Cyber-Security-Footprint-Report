Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of a cybersecurity footprint analysis conducted on the target domain halisans.com. The analysis aimed to identify potential security risks and vulnerabilities associated with the domain's online presence. Our findings reveal several areas of concern, including exposed WHOIS information, outdated software, and potential vulnerabilities to subdomain takeover. We recommend implementing security measures to mitigate these risks and improve the overall security posture of the domain.

Introduction

The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the cyber security footprint on the target domain halisans.com. The analysis involved gathering information about the domain's online presence, network infrastructure, and potential vulnerabilities. The findings of this report will help identify areas for improvement and provide recommendations for enhancing the security posture of the domain.

Methodology

The analysis was conducted using a combination of footprinting techniques, including:

1. DNSRECON : DNSRECON  was used to gather information about the domain's DNS records, including A records, MX records, and NS records.
2. WHOIS Lookups: WHOIS lookups were used to gather information about the domain's registrant, registrar, and contact details.
3 HOST. the host was used to discover the Halisans.com IP address 
4 Ping 
5 Dig- Dig was used for querying Domain Name System (DNS) servers. It's essentially an "information groper" for DNS records, allowing users to troubleshoot network issues, check DNS configurations, and analyze domain names key 
6  Spiderfoot-  It is used to gather and analyze data about IP addresses, domain names, usernames, and other online assets. Designed to automate the process of open-source intelligence gathering,
7 Nmap - ("Network Mapper") is a free and open-source utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.7 Nmap-

NESSUS SCAN FOR HALISANS.COM













































Observations:

- The host appears to be a web server with email services.
- Multiple email-related ports are open, indicating a potential email server.
- The presence of both HTTP and HTTPS suggests a secure connection is available.


     
4. Potential Vulnerabilities:
    
    - Exposed WHOIS information: registrant's contact details are publicly available
    - Potential subdomain takeover: (halisans.com ) may be vulnerable to takeover
      Open ports may be vulnerable to exploitation if not properly secured.
-     Outdated software or configurations may lead to security issues.





Recommendations

Based on the findings, we recommend the following:

1. Secure WHOIS information: Consider using a domain privacy service to protect sensitive registrant information.
2. Update software: Update Apache to the latest version to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
3. Monitor subdomains: Regularly monitor subdomains for potential takeover vulnerabilities.
4. Implement security measures: Implement security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption to protect the domain's infrastructure.
5- Ensure all services are up-to-date and properly configured.
6- Implement security measures such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
7- Regularly monitor and scan for potential vulnerabilities.
  

Conclusion

The cybersecurity footprint analysis revealed several areas of concern associated with (halisans.com ). By implementing the recommended security measures, the domain can reduce its attack surface and improve its overall security posture.
